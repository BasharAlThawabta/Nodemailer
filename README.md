# Nodemailer
I noticed that I was spending quite a bit of time composing emails – opening Gmail, creating new email drafts, and so on – especially when reaching out to multiple individuals. To address this, I developed a tool that enables me to send emails much more efficiently than before. This tool becomes even more powerful if you possess a DATABASE containing various email addresses. With just a single click, you can send out emails instantly.

I'm excited to share this tool with you and I believe it has the potential to be highly beneficial.

Application for send mails through web with gmail by using form to put the email you want to send for, I used Nodejs (express with nodemailer, EJS, bodyParser, path,   packages).
